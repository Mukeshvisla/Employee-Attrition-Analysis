# 🎵 Streaming Content Catalog Optimization (Advanced MySQL, Visualization)

### 📘 Overview
Analyzed a digital music streaming platform’s content catalog to identify high-quality but low-visibility songs that could be promoted for better engagement.

### 🧠 Objectives
- Detect songs with strong user satisfaction (ratings, completion rate) but low visibility (low streams).  
- Recommend promotion strategies for "hidden gems".  
- Create an analytical framework for measuring promotional impact.

### 🧰 Tools Used
- **MySQL (Advanced)** → Subqueries, CASE statements, and window functions for ranking song performance.  
- **Power BI / Tableau** → Visualization of top-performing genres and engagement.  
- **Python (optional)** → Data cleaning and validation.

### 💡 Key Insights
- Found a genre with *20% higher user rating* than average despite *lowest stream count*.  
- Created a “Hidden Gems” index combining completion rate and rating score.  
- Proposed an **A/B testing plan** to evaluate promotional uplift.
