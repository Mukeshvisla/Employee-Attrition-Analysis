# 👥 Employee Attrition Risk Assessment (Python, MySQL, Tableau)

### 📘 Overview
Analyzed employee data to identify the root causes of attrition and recommend strategies to improve retention.

### 🧠 Objectives
- Understand which factors most influence employees leaving the organization.  
- Predict attrition risk using statistical correlation and simple modeling.  
- Visualize HR trends by department, salary, and work-life balance.

### 🧰 Tools Used
- **MySQL** → Data cleaning and storage (1,500+ employee records).  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)** → Data analysis and correlation study.  
- **Tableau** → Dashboard showing department-wise attrition and HR metrics.

### 💡 Key Insights
- *Work-Life Balance* (-0.25 correlation) and *Job Satisfaction* (-0.24) were the strongest factors influencing attrition.  
- *Salary* had minimal impact on attrition compared to lifestyle balance.  
- HR dashboards enabled data-driven policy changes.
